## General Information
2D drawing desktop application implemented in Java, intended to create "pixelated" style art with a user difined canvas size and resolution.


## Technologies Used
- Java
- SimpleGraphics Library


## Setup
[Download here](https://github.com/JohnLacerdaOliveira/Modrianer) the intire repo and open it with IntellJ or any other JDK IDE and compile and run the project from there.


## Project Status
Current status is one of an alpha phase corresponding to a proof of concept, I'll consider it as a minimum viable product once features regardind v1.0 discribed [here](#room-for-improvement) are implemented. 


## Features
- Dynamically generated canvas size and resolution defined thru a start-up prompt
- Save and load features that store the image as .txt file allowing to save work in between sessions.


## Room for Improvement
v1.0
- Remove SimplyGraphics dependency and implement all graphical functionality thru Java .awt and swing libraries
- Ability to change the color using the colorChooser panel
- Ability to remove the grid
- Ability to print screen the canvas and export it as .jpeg file
